# Abstract
1.	Invasive plant species represent a significant global challenge as they compete with native plants for limited resources such as space, nutrients and pollinators, modifying thereby habitats, reducing biodiversity and impacting negatively on the fitness of native plant species.
2.	To succeed in this competition, invasive plant may display features particularly attractive for pollinators to ensure their reproduction and spread. It is, therefore, crucial to analyze their advertising strategies from a pollinator perspective.
3.	To approach this question, we focused on four invasive species that are widely spread in the French Pyrenees, Buddleja davidii, Reynoutria japonica, Spiraea japonica and Impatiens glandulifera, and analyzed their visual advertisement signals from the perspective of honey bee vision as bees are regular pollinators of these plants. We collected spectral reflections of invasive and surrounding native species in the French Pyrenees and used perceptual neural modelling of honey bee vision to characterize the color advertising strategies employed by these invasive species.
4.	 We found that the color advertising strategies of the four species considered were not homogeneous. R. japonica, S. japonica and B. davidii were inconspicuous against the background in achromatic and chromatic terms and could be hardly discriminated in terms of color from their surrounding native plants. These characteristics may promote generalization, potentially attracting visits from pollinators foraging on similar native species. I. glandulifera, presented three morphs, two of which (pink and violet) were both highly salient in chromatic and achromatic terms and very different from their surrounding native species. This distinctive identity thus facilitates their detection and learning in association with their rich nectar. The remaining white morph presented inconspicuous visual features, which raises the question of the alternative signals used for advertisement and of the recipients of these signals.
5.	By adopting the perspective of the sensory and cognitive abilities of pollinators, our study provides new elements for understanding biological invasion processes.
